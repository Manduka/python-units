* radians and steradians. They equal 1. What to do?
* Hz vs. Bq, gray vs. sievert... they are equivalent, but mean different things. What to do?
* Built-in python time units should box/unbox with time quantities
  * In general, python objects that refer to quantities should play nicely with this module...
* Predefined units:
  * Areas
  * imperial units
  * [unusual units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement)
* Dependency-injecting the unit registry has lots of boilerplate. Solution?
* Someone is going to use different registries in the same program. Prevent? Treat as namespaces?
* py.test assertions that the global registry is left unpolluted after each test file
  * In general, test the registry system.
* How to interpret Figleaf output?
* Instead of hasattr'ing parameters and using asserts to determine whether we can convert units or not, we could instead just do the conversion we want to do, raising a NotImplemented upon failure.
