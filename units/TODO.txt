* radians and steradians. They equal 1. What to do?
* Hz vs. Bq, gray vs. sievert... they are equivalent, but mean different things. What to do?
* Built-in python time units should box/unbox with time quantities
  * In general, python objects that refer to quantities should play nicely with this module...
* Predefined units:
  * Areas
  * imperial units
  * [unusual units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement)

* the __round__ protocol seems to be py3k only...
* How to interpret Figleaf output?
